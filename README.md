# DOST-DCST-Stockwell-Transform
This code allows the computation of the discrete orthonormal Stockwell transform (DOST) and the discrete cosine Stockwell transform (DCST) in 1D and 2D. The implemented algorithm is FFT-fast.
The folder includes:
ST_algorithms.pdf - a graphical description of the implemented algorithms;
ST_tutorial.m - a tutorial that describes the use of these transform in 1d and 2d;
ST.m - the implementation of the algorithm.

In the files, you can find a brief description of the Stockwell transform (S-transform) together with a short reference list.
